# Udacity_Jasmine_testing
RMIT project 3 - Feeder reader testing

##Objective
In this project, I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application has incomplete Jasmine test suites, and I write the remaining test suites and get them to pass. The goal is to learn about JavaScript testing, which is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD.
